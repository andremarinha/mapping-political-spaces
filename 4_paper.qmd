  This paper analyses the structure and social structuring of political
  conflict over time in Southern Europe --- Portugal, Spain, Greece, and
  Italy --- using data from the European Social Survey (Rounds 1--11,
  ~2002--2022). Drawing on the Geometric Data Analysis tradition, the
  analysis pursues two objectives: identifying how many dimensions
  structure political conflict at different points in time and how these
  are composed; and analysing how political spaces are socially structured,
  focusing on the positioning of Oesch social classes and their proximity
  to political parties.

# Introduction

<!-- Political conflict in Southern Europe after the Great Recession -->
<!-- Gap: longitudinal, multi-country, relational approach -->

# Political Space as Relational Structure

<!-- GDA tradition: Bourdieu, Benzécri, Le Roux & Rouanet -->
<!-- Oesch class schema: work logic + employment relation axes -->

# Data and Methods

## European Social Survey

<!-- Rounds 1-11, integrated file, 4 countries -->
<!-- Adult population (18+), 67,358 observations -->

## Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Multiple Factor Analysis

<!-- Country-specific MCA -->
<!-- MFA/STATIS for diachronic comparison -->
<!-- Disjunctive coding (primary); numeric coding (robustness) -->

## Social Class Operationalisation

<!-- Oesch 16/8/5, ORDC, EGP -->

## Political Participation Profiles

<!-- Latent Class Analysis (Oser 2022; Jeroense & Spierings 2023) -->

# Dimensionality and Composition of Political Conflict

<!-- How many dimensions? How are they composed? -->
<!-- Eigenvalues, modified rates, dimension interpretation -->

# Social Structuring: Class Positions and Party Proximities

<!-- How are Oesch classes positioned? -->
<!-- How close are they to political parties? -->
<!-- Change over time -->

# Participation Profiles

<!-- LCA results: country-specific + regional -->

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!-- Summary, contribution, limitations -->
