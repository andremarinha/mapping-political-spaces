# Session Log — 2026-02-12

## Session 1: Project Documentation Setup

### Actions taken

1. **Inspected full folder structure**
   - Catalogued all directories, files, and their purposes
   - Identified active pipeline (`scripts/legacy/v2_archive/R_scripts/01–05`)
   - Confirmed master data at `data/master/ess_final.rds`

2. **Created `CLAUDE.md`** (project root)
   - Concise project brief for Claude Code sessions
   - Covers: project identity, tools, folder structure, pipeline, class schemes, coding strategy, analytical method, interpretation constraints, weighting, visualization standards

3. **Created `README.md`** (project root, 17 sections)
   - Comprehensive documentation of the entire project
   - Sections: Abstract, Theoretical Orientation, Research Questions, Data, Data Engineering Pipeline, Class Schemes, Coding Strategy, Attitudinal Variables (with [TBD] placeholders for Phase 1), Multi-Table Analytical Strategy, Phase-by-Phase Plan, Interpretation Rules, Limitations, Visualization Standards, Folder Structure, Decision Log (D01–D09), Key Outputs, References
   - Legacy README preserved at `legacy/README_04_02_2026.md`

4. **Created `log/` directory and session logging system**
   - Session logs stored at `log/session_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Each session documents actions taken, decisions made, and next steps

5. **Noted reference material**: `scripts/legacy/Análise multivariada_A2_ACM_AC.qmd`
   - MCA + Cluster Analysis tutorial (FactoMineR/factoextra, hobbies dataset)
   - 6-step MCA workflow: data adequacy → dimensionality → interpret dimensions → interpret categories → supplementary variables → cluster analysis
   - Articulation of MCA with hierarchical + K-means clustering (Carvalho 2008 approach)
   - Registered as methodological inspiration for future analysis phases

### Decisions made
- All four countries (PT, ES, GR, IT) documented as part of the analysis
- New `README.md` is authoritative; legacy README is historical record only
- Attitudinal variable sections use `[TBD]` placeholders for Phase 1
- `log/` folder created at project root for session-level tracking
- `CLAUDE.md` updated every session as the persistent context file

### Current project state
- **Data engineering**: Complete (pipeline v2, master file produced)
- **Documentation**: Complete (CLAUDE.md + README.md)
- **Analysis Phase 1** (item selection and harmonisation): Not started
- **Analysis Phase 2** (multi-table construction): Not started
- **Analysis Phase 3** (dimensionality): Not started
- **Analysis Phase 4** (structuring): Not started

### Next steps
- Begin Phase 1: attitudinal variable selection and harmonisation
- Identify candidate ESS items available across all 11 rounds
- Audit category stability and missingness patterns
