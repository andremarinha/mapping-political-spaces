# Session Log — 2026-02-13

## Session 1: Governance Hardening & Git Setup

### Context
User clarified the project's dual output (PhD chapter + Q1 journal manuscript) and its working title: "All Quiet on the Southern Front? Mapping the Political Spaces in twenty-first century Southern Europe". Established three governance rules and set up version control.

### Actions taken

1. **Updated `CLAUDE.md`**
   - Added manuscript title and dual-output framing (PhD chapter + Q1 journal)
   - Created **Iron Rules** section: (1) never delete files, (2) always log, (3) interpretation constraints
   - Added dual-repository info (Google Drive + GitHub)
   - Updated folder structure to reflect `.gitignore` annotations and `scripts/archive/`
   - Removed duplicate interpretation constraints section (consolidated into Iron Rules)
   - Updated Session History with today's entry

2. **Updated `README.md`**
   - Changed title to working manuscript title
   - Added output framing (PhD chapter + Q1 journal) to Abstract
   - Added Section 1b: Repositories and Replication
   - Added Section 3: Project Governance (no-delete policy, logging requirement, decision log reference)
   - Renumbered all sections (old 3–17 → new 4–19) to accommodate new sections
   - Fixed internal cross-references (Section 4 → 5 for data source, Section 15 → 16 for decision log)
   - Updated folder structure tree to show `.gitignore` annotations and `scripts/archive/`
   - Added governance decisions D10–D12 to the Decision Log

3. **Created `.gitignore`**
   - Excludes: `data/` (raw, temp, master, archive), `articles/`, `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.claude/`, system files
   - Keeps: scripts, figures, tables, logs, misc (ESS docs), legacy, documentation

4. **Initialized git repository**
   - `git init` in project root
   - Staged 48 files (all tracked content)
   - Initial commit: `f8a1ee2`
   - GitHub remote not yet configured (user must create the repository first)

### Decisions made

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D10 | No-delete policy | Protects audit trail and reproducibility |
| D11 | Mandatory session logging | Ensures continuity across sessions |
| D12 | Dual-repository setup (Google Drive + GitHub) | Working copy + version control/replication |

### Files created
- `.gitignore`
- `log/session_2026-02-13.md` (this file)

### Files modified
- `CLAUDE.md` — Iron Rules, manuscript identity, repositories, folder structure, session history
- `README.md` — Title, abstract, Section 1b, Section 3, renumbered sections, folder structure, decision log

### Current project state
- **Data engineering**: Complete (pipeline v2, master file produced)
- **Documentation**: Updated with governance rules and manuscript framing
- **Version control**: Git initialized, initial commit made, GitHub remote pending
- **Analysis Phase 1** (item selection and harmonisation): Not started

### GitHub remote connected
- Repository: `github.com/andremarinha/mapping-political-spaces`
- Remote added and initial commit pushed to `origin/master`
- Updated repo URL in `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`

### Next steps
- Connect GitHub remote once repository is created
- Begin Phase 1: attitudinal variable selection and harmonisation
