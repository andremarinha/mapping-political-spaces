## Session 1: Reorganization Completion + LCA-MCA Analysis Planning

### Actions Taken

1. **Completed Humphreys-style reorganization (from 2026-02-16)**
   - Updated `# Path:` cosmetic comments in all 6 R scripts (`scripts/01_cleaning.R` through `scripts/06_participation.R`)
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md`: new folder structure, workflow architecture diagram (Humphreys pattern), updated archive path references, added 2026-02-16 session entry
   - Updated `0_README.md`: pipeline path (`scripts/` not `scripts/legacy/v2_archive/R_scripts/`), folder structure (Section 15), archive references (`legacy/archive/`), Oesch source path (`scripts/helpers/`), methodological reference path (`legacy/reference_qmd/`)

2. **Data audit for LCA planning**
   - Inspected all participation variables in master dataset
   - Confirmed 6 existing dummies (badge_d, bctprd_d, contplt_d, sgnptit_d, pbldmn_d, vote_d) cover R1–11
   - Identified additional undummied items: wrkorg, wrkprty (R1–9 only), clsprty (R1–11, but conceptually different), pstplonl (R8–11), donprty (R10–11)
   - Decision: proceed with 6 existing dummies for full R1–11 coverage
   - Audited complete cases: 62,193 / 67,358 (92.3%) — adequate for LCA
   - Audited response patterns: 63 unique out of 64 possible; top pattern "000001" (voted only) = 52.8%
   - Country-round structure: PT (11 rounds), ES (11 rounds), GR (5 rounds), IT (6 rounds)
   - Checked R package availability: poLCA and multilevLCA NOT installed; nnet, survey, FactoMineR, factoextra installed
   - Checked Oesch-8 (85.3% coverage) and ORDC (82.1% coverage) — ready for regression

3. **LCA-MCA implementation plan drafted**
   - 5-stage architecture: LCA → Multinomial regression → Time dynamics → Cross-national comparison → MCA articulation
   - Pooled within-country LCA (K=2 to K=6), BIC + entropy + interpretability for model selection
   - Class enters AFTER repertoire definition (separation principle)
   - MCA social space from structural indicators; repertoires projected as supplementary
   - Plan saved to `.claude/plans/` for future implementation

4. **Housekeeping**
   - Moved 2 temporary audit scripts to `legacy/audit_scripts/` (Iron Rule 1)
   - Committed all reorganization changes

### Decisions Made

- **D17**: LCA indicator set = 6 existing dummies (badge_d, bctprd_d, contplt_d, sgnptit_d, pbldmn_d, vote_d), full R1–11 coverage. Rationale: maximises diachronic comparability for pooled-within-country LCA; alternative 8-item set (adding wrkorg, wrkprty) would restrict to R1–9.
- **D18**: Humphreys workflow reorganization adopted. Rationale: separates data engineering (R scripts) from analysis (Quarto), enables shared workspace for paper/presentation/exports.

### Current Project State

- Project restructured for Humphreys-style workflow
- Data pipeline functional (scripts/ 01–06)
- Master dataset: 67,358 × 1,688
- LCA-MCA implementation plan ready but NOT yet coded
- Packages poLCA and multilevLCA need installing before LCA can run

### Next Steps

- Install poLCA (and marginaleffects, patchwork) in R
- Implement LCA-MCA analysis in `1_analysis.qmd` following the approved plan
- Run LCA models per country, inspect BIC/entropy/item-response probabilities
- Select K per country based on BIC + substantive interpretability
